= Blocks

How do you render your blocks of code?

The idea of this gem is simple (yet difficult to see the practical application for): blocks of code, regardless of code, whether they are a ruby block or a rails partial, are, or should be, completely interchangeable.

This gem seeks to set an order of precedence for how rails determines how to render a block of code.
