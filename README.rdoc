= Blocks

I AM CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF WRITING THIS DOCUMENTATION OVER AGAIN SINCE A LOT HAS CHANGED SINCE THE DOCUMENTATION WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN.

How do you render your blocks of code?

The idea of this gem is simple (yet difficult to see the practical application for): blocks of code, regardless of code, whether they are a ruby block or a rails partial, are, or should be, completely interchangeable.

This gem seeks to set an order of precedence for how rails determines how to render a block of code.
