Wrappers work almost identically to around hooks with the exception that there may be multiple hooks of the same type but only a single wrapper of a particular type. There are three types of wrappers, one for each of the levels mentioned above.

Wrappers are like Hooks but they are singular; i.e. only a single wrapper of a given type may exist for a Block. There are three different wrapper types: wrap_all, wrap_each, and wrapper.
